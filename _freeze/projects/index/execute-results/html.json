In the PanArcN subgroup, we are investigating how release of nitrogen-rich permafrost organic matter affect greenhouse exchange over the pan-Arctic region, and its implication for climate change feedbacks. We are applying observational-based relationships to the next-generation QUINCY-ICON-LAND model. We are also taking part in a joint campaign with the Q-ARCTIC project to advance spatial quantifications of the N~2~O flux. </font> \n\n<br />\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Climate Feedbacks from the Release of Permafrost Nitrogen](permafrostNfeedbacks.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n----\n\n### Climate Reversibility of Overshoot\n<br />\nOvershooting the 1.5 °C of global warming set in the Paris Agreement is growing increasingly likely. By applying global Earth System models in novel scenarios, I am collaborating with [Thomas Frölicher](https://www.tfroelicher.com) and [Regina Rodrigues](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://twitter.com/rrrocean%3Flang%3Den&ved=2ahUKEwiu7_LN6smJAxVz_rsIHffYMloQFnoECDEQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2Ad6leLK7hFPuwZQ_wca1z) to better understand the reversibility of climate change impacts under overshoot scenarios. \n\n<br />\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Global Temperature under Overshoot Scenarios, from Lacroix et al. 2024 Earth's future](overshoot.png){width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n### Impacts of Global Eutrophication for Coastal Ocean Greenhouse Gases and Ecosystem\n<br />\nI am leading a paper on impacts of combined changes in climate and human-induced eutrophication for the coastal ocean ecosystem. Our results show a stronger perturbation of ecosystem indicators in the coastal ocean with respect to the global ocean, with river-induced eutrophication responsible for significant change in globally-averaged biologicaly productivity.  \n\n<br />\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Global Coastal Ocean CO~2~ Flux, from Mathis et al., 2024, Nature Climate Change](coastalocean_co2.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n----\n\n### River-2-Ocean MIP\n<br />\nAs a key collaborator in the River-2-Ocean Model Intercomparison Project, we are seeking to better quantify the influence of rivers on the global ocean CO2 flux. We thereby have provided a novel protocol and river forcing dataset to better quantify river-induced CO~2~ outgassing. The protocol consists of a preindustrial part, where reference model simulation and a simulation accounting for river effects are performed, as well as simulations with changing climate, atmospheric CO2 and river C, N and P inputs to the ocean.\n\n----\n",
