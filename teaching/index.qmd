### Nitrogen cycle

My take on the nitrogen cycle in [a short presentation](nitrogen_cycle_recap.pdf)

and collaborative [summary Chapter](https://geco-bern.github.io/les/nutrients.html), originating from a student project. 

Both materials are part of the [Land in the Earth System 2](https://geco-bern.github.io/les2_course) course given at the Institute of Geography, University of Bern.

### Oceanography

[Slides](Lecture_physical_oceanography_mpg_bgc.pptx) for a course on basic principles of oceanography and carbon cycling in the ocean, was given for the Max-Planck-Institute for Biogeochemistry IMPRS graduate level course ("Atmosphere, Land and Ocean in the Earth system").
